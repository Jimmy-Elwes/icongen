To convert the SVG to a TTF font, you can use a tool like FontForge. Below are the steps to do this manually, as automating this entirely in Python is quite complex.

Using FontForge (Manually)
Install FontForge: Install FontForge on your system. You can download it from FontForge's official site.

Create a New Font:

Open FontForge.
Create a new font (File -> New).
Import the SVG:

Select the glyph you want to edit (double-click on any cell in the font overview).
Import the SVG file (File -> Import).
Save the Font:

Save the font as a TTF file (File -> Generate Fonts...).
